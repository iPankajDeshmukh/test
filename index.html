	<h1>Rangoli:-</h1>
	<p>Rangoli is an art form originating in the Indian subcontinent, in which patterns are created on the floor or a
		tabletop using materials such as powdered lime stone, red ochre, dry rice flour, coloured sand, quartz powder,
		flower petals, and coloured rocks. It is an everyday practice in Hindu households, however the colours are
		preferred during festivals and other important celebrations as it is time consuming.</p><br>
	<p> The rangoli represents the<ins> happiness, positivity and liveliness of a household, and is intended to welcome

			<mark>Lakshmi</mark>, the goddess of wealth and good luck</ins>. It is believed that a Hindu household
		without a clean entrance and
		rangoli is an abode of darida (bad luck).</p>
